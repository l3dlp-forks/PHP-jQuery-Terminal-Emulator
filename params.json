To install simply place on your server and modify the term.php file to set password, default directory, etc.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nPlease don't be stupid. Depending on your server setup this could potentially open you up to some major security issues if not properly locked down. The system uses sessions for \r\nauthentication but that doesn't mean an extra layer of protection wouldn't be a good idea.\r\n",
